As expansive as the options are for courses to learn development, it's still virtually impossible to find a course that will meet you exactly where you are in your journey.

Every option will be making assumptions about both what you know, and what you don't know.

This is no exception.

The first module of the Full Stack JavaScript Developer Nanodegree focuses on 5 main things: Backend Basics, NodeJS, TypeScript, Jasmine, and Express.

For me, those first 3 were not particularly useful. I still took the time to go through them though, to ensure I had the basics of what they expected me to know about these topics down.

Despite knowing most everything the course covered in those first 3 modules, I felt that the pace itself was still a bit quick. Watching the videos at 150% speed, and doing the excercises and quizes was not the drain that courses can often be.

The courses overall strike a good balance between beig thorough and also not hand-holding. They leave enough room for you to figure out things on your own while giving a decent enough foundation that you can go with in some direction.

This held up as I entered the Jasmine and Express modules, where I had pretty close to no knowledge. I had basic familiarity with unit testing (not Jasmine in particular) and Express, but no actual experience with either (aside from Netlify Functions).

Those modules did do plenty to keep me on my toes.

When I reached the Project, I felt I had enough coverage to make a go of it without needing to seek out help, and this proved to be *mostly* true.

The project for the first module was to develop an express endpoint for serving images from your server, specifically with the option of using query params to perform on-the-fly transformations.

If you've ever used Cloudinary before, you know what this looks like from the client-side.

It was nice to do this myself. The project felt appropriate for what was taught thus far, and real worldy enough to keep things interesting.

I did have trouble using relative paths to some `fs` methods and needed to resort to some rather ugly path resolution code, but it all functions well enough.

Overall, if you're familiar with the technologies used, you should have very little challenge blowing through this first section.
