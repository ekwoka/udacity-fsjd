This project used my code from the past projects instead of the Udagram application. This was due to the udagram project being unfamiliar and the udacity workspace being quite awful to actually use.

Static Host: http://fsjdbucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
Api: 
- [storefront-api-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com](storefront-api-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/) (Returns 'Hello World')
- [storefront-api-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/products](storefront-api-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/products )
(Won't return any products, just an empty array)
